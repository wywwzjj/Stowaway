Stowaway is a Multi-hop proxy tool for security researchers and pentesters

Users can easily proxy their network traffic to intranet nodes (multi-layer),break the restrction and manipulate all the
nodes that under your control XD

PS: Thanks for everyone's star, i'm just an amateur, and the code still need be optimized,so if you find anything wrong
or bugs, feel free to tell me, prs and issues are welcome :kissing_heart:.

PPS: **Please read the usage method and the precautions at the end of the article before use!**

## Usage

### Character

Stowaway has two kinds of characters:

- ```admin```  The master used by the penetration tester
- ```agent```  The slave deployed by the penetration tester

### Noun definition

- Node: refers to admin || agent
- Active mode: Refers to the currently operating node actively connecting to another node
- Passive mode: Refers to the currently operating node listening to a port and waiting for another node to connect
- Upstream: Refers to the traffic between the currently operating node and its parent node
- Downstream: Refers to the traffic between the currently operating node and **all ** child nodes

### Parameter analysis

- admin

```
parameter:
-l Listening address in passive mode [ip]:<port>
-s node communication encryption key, all nodes (admin&&agent) must be consistent
-c target node address in active mode
--proxy socks5 proxy server address
--proxyu socks5 proxy server username (optional)
--proxyp socks5 proxy server password (optional)
--down downstream protocol type, default is bare TCP traffic, optional HTTP
```

- agent

```
parameter:
-l Listening address in passive mode [ip]:<port>
-s node communication encryption key
-c target node address in active mode
--proxy socks5 proxy server address
--proxyu socks5 proxy server username (optional)
--proxyp socks5 proxy server password (optional)
--reconnect reconnect time interval
--rehost the IP address to be reused
--report the Port number to be reused
--up upstream protocol type, default is bare TCP traffic, optional HTTP
--down downstream protocol type, default is bare TCP traffic, optional HTTP
```

### Parameter usage

#### -l

This parameter can be used on admin&&agent, only can be used in passive mode

If you do not specify an IP address, the default monitoring IP address will be  ```0.0.0.0```

- admin:  ```./stowaway_admin -l 9999``` or ```./stowaway_admin -l 127.0.0.1:9999```

- agent:  ```./stowaway_agent -l 9999```  or ```./stowaway_agent -l 127.0.0.1:9999```

#### -s

This parameter can be used on admin&&agent, can be used in both active && passive mode

This parameter is optional, if it is not set, it means that the communication is not encrypted, otherwise, the
communication is encrypted based on the key given by the user

- admin:  ```./stowaway_admin -l 9999 -s 123```

- agent:  ```./stowaway_agent -l 9999 -s 123```

#### -c

This parameter can be used on admin&&agent, only can be used in active mode

Declaring the address of the node you want to connect to

- admin:  ```./stowaway_admin -c 127.0.0.1:9999```

- agent:  ```./stowaway_agent -c 127.0.0.1:9999```

#### --proxy/--proxyu/--proxyp

These three parameters can be used on admin&&agent , only can be used in active mode

```--proxy``` represents the address of the socks5 proxy server, ```--proxyu``` and ```--proxyp``` are optional

No username and password：

- admin:  ```./stowaway_admin -c 127.0.0.1:9999 --proxy xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx```

- agent:  ```./stowaway_agent -c 127.0.0.1:9999 --proxy xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx```

Username and password:

- admin:  ```./stowaway_admin -c 127.0.0.1:9999 --proxy xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx --proxyu xxx --proxyp xxx```

- agent:  ```./stowaway_agent -c 127.0.0.1:9999 --proxy xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx--proxyu xxx --proxyp xxx```

#### --up/--down

These two parameter can be used on admin&&agent, can be used both in active && passive mode

But note that there is no ```--up``` parameter on admin

These two parameters are optional. If they are not set, it means that the upstream/downstream traffic is bare TCP
traffic.

If you want the upstream/downstream traffic to be HTTP traffic, just set these two parameters

- admin:  ```./stowaway_admin -c 127.0.0.1:9999 --down http```

- agent:  ```./stowaway_agent -c 127.0.0.1:9999 --up http```
  or ```./stowaway_agent -c 127.0.0.1:9999 --up http --down http```

**Note that when you set the upstream/downstream of a node to TCP/HTTP traffic, the downstream/upstream traffic of it's
parent/child node must be set to be consistent! ! ! **

Like this:

- admin:  ```./stowaway_admin -c 127.0.0.1:9999 --down http```

- agent:  ```./stowaway_agent -l 9999 --up http```

In the above case, the agent must set ```--up``` to http, otherwise it will cause network errors

The rules between admin--agent is as same as agent--agent

We can just assume agent-1 is waiting for the connection of the child node on the port ```127.0.0.1:10000```,
and ```--down http``` is set

Then, agent-2 must also set ```--up``` to http, otherwise it will cause network errors

- agent-2:  ```./stowaway_agent -c 127.0.0.1:10000 --up http```

#### --reconnect

This parameter can be used on agent , only can be used in active mode

The parameter is optional. If not set, it means that the node will not actively reconnect after the network connection
is disconnected.Otherwise, it means that the node will try to reconnect to the parent node every x (the number of
seconds you set) seconds.

- admin:  ```./stowaway_admin -l 9999```

- agent:  ```./stowaway_agent -c 127.0.0.1:9999 --reconnect 10```

In the above case, it means that if the connection between the agent and the admin is disconnected, the agent will try
to reconnect back to the admin every ten seconds.

The rules between admin--agent is as same as agent--agent

And ```--reconnect``` parameter can be used together with ```--proxy```/```--proxyu```/```--proxyp```. The agent will
base on its own settings at startup and try to reconnect through the proxy when the parent node disconnected

#### --rehost/--report

These two parameters are quite special and can be only used on the agent side. For details, please check the port reuse
mechanism below

## Port reuse

Now Stowaway provide two port reuse functions:One is based on SO_REUSEPORT/SO_REUSEADDR features and the other is base
on IPTABLES features

- In Linux environment, stowaway can reuse most ports
- In Windows environment,it cannot reuse service port like IIS,RDP, but can reuse Mysql,Apache and so on

### 复用方式

- SO_REUSEPORT/SO_REUSEADDR

  Assuming that the agent side is using the port reuse mechanism to reuse port 80

  In order to do this, the agent must set the ```--rehost```&&```--report```&&```-s``` parameter at startup

    - ```--rehost``` represents the IP address that you want to reuse, it cannot be 0.0.0.0, it should generally be the
      external address of the network card

    - ```--report```represents the port that you want to reuse

    - ```-s``` represents communication key

  **This mode mainly supports windows and mac, linux is also possible, but there are more restrictions**

    - admin：```./stowaway_admin -c 192.168.0.105:80 -s 123```
    - agent： ```./stowaway_agent --report 80 --rehost 192.168.0.105 -s 123```


- IPTABLES

  Assuming that the agent side is using port reuse mechanism to reuse port 22

  In order to do this, the agent must set the ```-l```&&```--report```&&```-s``` parameter at startup

    - ```-l``` represents the port that cannot be accessed normally, in other words, it's the port you really want the
      agent to listen to and accept connections

    - ```--report``` represents the port that you want to reuse

    - ```-s``` represents communication key

  **This method only support linux, agent will manipulate IPTABLES automatically,root permission is required**

    - agent： ```./stowaway_agent --report 22 -l 10000 -s 123```

      After the agent is started like above, please use ```reuse.py``` in the ```script``` directory first

      Set the value of SECRET (the value of SECRET is the communication key, aka -s option)

      Then execute：```python reuse.py --start --rhost xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx --rport 22```

        - --rhost represents the address of the agent

        - --rport represents the port to be reused, in this case it should be 22

    - At this time, the admin can connect this agent：```./stowaway_admin -c xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:22 -s 123```

### Notice

- The above situation only lists the connection between the admin and the agent, the connection between the agents is
  also the same, completely no difference

- If node is killed by ctrl-c or command `kill`,it will clean up the iptables rules automatically,but if it is killed by
  command `kill -9`,then it can't do that and it will lead to the service originally run on the reusing port cannot be
  reached,so in order to avoid this situation ,the reuse.py provide the function that can stop the "port reusing"
  function.

  If you want to stop "port reusing",just run reuse.py like
  this: `python reuse.py --stop --rhost 192.168.0.105 --rport 22`

  And then the "port reusing" will be closed,and the service originally run on the reusing port can be reached again

- If you use the port reusing mode via IPTABLES , the agent will be forced to monitor on ```0.0.0.0```, and you cannot
  specify ip+port by the ```-l ```option

## How to build a multi-level network?

As you can see from the above example, only admin and one agent are present

But the multi-level network is the core of stowaway

In stowaway, the formation of a multi-level network requires the help of ```listen```, ```connect```, ```sshtunnel```
commands in admin

Here is a simple example

- admin: ```./stowaway_admin -l 9999 -s 123```

At this time agent-1 has connected to admin

- agent-1:  ```./stowaway_agent -c 127.0.0.1:9999 -s 123```

If the user also wants to add agent-2 as follows

- agent-2:  ```./stowaway_agent -l 10000 -s 123```

Then, at this time, the user can enter ```use 0``` -> ```connect agent-2's IP:10000``` through admin to add agent-2 to
the network and become a child node of agent-1

After that,If the user wants to add another node agent-3 too, but cannot access agent-3 through agent-1

Then,in order to solve this problem, the user can enter ```use 0``` -> ```listen``` through admin ->
select ```1.Normal Passive``` -> enter ```10001``` So that agent-1will listen on port 10001 and waiting for the
connection of child node

After the admin operation is completed, agent-3 can be started as follows

- agent-3: ```./stowaway_agent -c 127.0.0.1:10001 -s 123```

Then agent-3 can be added to the network as another child node of agent-1

For a detailed introduction of ```listen``` and ```sshtunnel```, please check the command analysis below

## How to reconnect?

Stowaway currently supports multiple ways of reconnection, briefly summarized as follows

First of all, when the parent node goes offline, only one kind of node will voluntarily exit: The node in active mode
and has no reconnection settings at startup.

If reconnection setting is set, the node will try to reconnect in the specified time interval

In addition, all nodes started in passive mode will not actively exit, but will re-monitor on the specified port based
on the parameters at startup. At this time, the user can still use ```connect```, ```sshtunnel``` to connect these nodes
back to the network

## Some points you should know

1. **If a branch is disconnected due to network fluctuations or an intermediate node is disconnected, please be sure to
   connect to the head node of the missing chain when actively reconnecting **
   **For example, node1 is followed by admin, and node1 is divided into two branches, one is node1->node 2 -> node 3 ->
   node 4, and the other is node1->node 5 ->node 6, then if If node2 is offline, node3 and node4 will not be offline,
   but will continue to survive. At this time, if the user wants to rejoin node3 and node4 to the network, the user has
   two choices. One is that if node1 can directly access node3, then the user can rejoin the network at any time using
   the connect or sshtunnel command on node1 (remember, even if node1 can also access node4 at the same time, please do
   not directly connect to node4, please connect the head node node3 of the entire missing chain (node3->node4), so that
   you can rejoin node3 and node4 to the network; another option is when node1 cannot access node3 directly (that means,
   you must go through node2), then please restart node2 and join the network, and then use the connect or sshtunnel
   command on node2 to connect to node3, thereby adding node3 and node4 to the network. **
2. **When a node is offline, all ```socks```, ```backward```, and ```forward``` services related to this node and its
   child nodes will be forcibly stopped**

## Command analysis

In the admin console, users can use tabs to auto-complete commands, and use the arrow keys to search history/move the
cursor

The admin console is divided into two levels, the first level is the main panel, and the commands included are as
follows

- ```help```: Display the help information of the main panel

```
(admin) >> help
  help                                     		Show help information

  exit                                            Exit Stowaway 
```

- ```listen```: Ask the agent to monitor on certain port and wait for the connection of the child node

```
(node 0) >> listen
[*] MENTION! If you choose IPTables Reuse or SOReuse,you MUST CONFIRM that the node was initially started in the corresponding way!
[*] When you choose IPTables Reuse or SOReuse, the node will use the initial config(when node started) to reuse port!
[*] Please choose the mode(1.Normal passive / 2.IPTables Reuse / 3.SOReuse): 1
[*] Please input the [ip:]<port> : 10001
[*] Waiting for response......
[*] Node is listening on 10001
```

Note that ```listen``` is a special command. As you can see, the ```listen``` command has three modes

1. ```Normal passive```: This option means that the agent will listen on the target port in a normal way and waiting for
   the child node to connect
2. ```IPTables Reuse```：This option means that the agent will reuse the port via IPTables Reuse and waiting for the
   child node to connect
3. ```SOReuse```：This option means that the agent will reuse the port via SOReuse and waiting for the child node to
   connect

The first mode is the most commonly used. If the parent node listens in this way, then the child node only
needs ```-c parent node ip:port``` to join the network

The second and third modes are quite special. If the user chooses the second or third mode, the user must ensure that
the currently operating node itself is started by port reusing, otherwise these two cannot be used

The second and third modes will not require the user to input any information, the node will automatically use its own
startup parameters to reuse the port, and prepare to accept the connection of the child node

In addition, ```listen``` can only accept the connection of one child node at a time. If multiple child nodes are
required to connect, please execute the ```listen``` command for the corresponding number of times

- ```addmemo```: Add a memo for the current node

```
(node 0) >> addmemo test
[*] Memo added!
(node 0) >> exit
(admin) >> detail

## TODO

- [ ] Fix the bug that may exists

### Attention

- This porject is coding just 4 fun , the logic structure and code structure are not strict enough, please don't be so
  serious about it
- Admin node MUST be online if you want to add a new node into the network
- The admin only supports one directly connected agent node, but the agent node has no such restriction
- If users use the admin on windows, please download [ansicon](https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon/releases) first, or
  download from [here](), and then enter the folder corresponding to the number of system bits.
  Execute ```ansicon.exe -i```, otherwise garbled characters will appear on the admin
- This program only supports standard ```UDP ASSOCIATE``` described in [RFC1928](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1928.txt).
  Please check the programs(such as scanners, etc.) you are using, make sure if the packet construction method comply
  with the standard [RFC1928](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1928.txt). Besides, the packet loss situation also needs to be
  handled by yourself.
